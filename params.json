HTML5 Hacks is a group of [HTML5 Evangelist/Makers](https://github.com/html5hacks?tab=members) that enjoy pushing the limits of modern web technologies and the programming languages of the Web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. \r\n\r\nBy creating 'bundles' of hacks packaged into web applications that leverage the Twitter Bootstrap UI and are deployed to remote git repository endpoints such as Github and Heroku, the community of hackers can fork, share, and contribute back to each bundled application. \r\n\r\nHTML5 Hacks represents a crossroads between open source social coding, 'Maker' culture, and application development with future-friendly, standards based, web technologies. \r\n\r\nNew to Git?\r\n-----------\r\nGit is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.\r\n\r\nGit is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows. For getting started with Git see [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com/) as a starting point.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew to Github?\r\n-----------\r\nGitHub is one of the most popular places to host open source code, because it's free for open source projects and has good integration with the open-source version control system Git. Github's documentation is outstanding, so for more on using Git and Github see [Github help](https://help.github.com) as a starting point.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick start\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nHTML5 Hacks Chapter 3 is a simple, Node.js application. \r\n\r\n## Getting the Hacks\r\n\r\nTo access the latest code from a particular chapter, clone the repo.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:html5hacks/chapter4.git\r\n$ cd chapter4\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nOr [download the latest release](https://github.com/html5hacks/chapter4/archive/master.zip).\r\n\r\nYou can instead fork this repo by clicking the \"Fork\" button above\r\n\r\nClone your fork to make a local working copy:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:[your_github_username]/chapter4.git\r\n$ cd chapter4\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n## Setting up Dependencies\r\n\r\nInstall [node.js](http://nodejs.org/#download).\r\n\r\nMake sure your current directory is chapter4 before moving to the next step.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n$ cd [your repos path]/chapter4\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nInstall dependencies using the node package manger (npm).\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n$ sudo npm install\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n## Running the App\r\n\r\nStart the chapter4 demo server from a different terminal window:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n$ node app\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nVisit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a web browser.","google":"UA-36542840-4","name":"Chapter4","tagline":"O'Reilly HTML5 Hacks Chapter 4 - Graphics"}
